REM  Indexes go with the rules. They used to be left out entirely, so a query
REM  needing a composite index threw failed-precondition in production while
REM  firestore.indexes.json sat on disk looking correct. Deploying them here
REM  costs nothing when unchanged. Note indexes BUILD after deploying - a large
REM  collection can take a few minutes before the query starts working.
