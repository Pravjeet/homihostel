/// A dialog is pushed onto the root Navigator, so its context sits *above*
/// SessionScope. Anything reading `Session.of` in its build throws the moment
/// it opens — and `flutter analyze` cannot see it, because the lookup fails at
/// runtime, not compile time. This dialog shipped with exactly that bug: the
/// room tile turned into a red error screen on tap.
///
/// So the invariant is pinned here: it must build with no SessionScope anywhere
/// above it. Permissions arrive as constructor arguments, read by the calling
/// page where the scope does exist.
///
/// Pumped with `canSeeRoster: false` deliberately. That is the branch which
/// never touches `DataService.instance`, so no Firebase is needed — and it is
/// still enough to prove the widget does not depend on an inherited Session.
